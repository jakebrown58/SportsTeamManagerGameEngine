# Draft Game v 1.01

This is a game that puts you in the role of General Manager of some abstract sports team.  

Can you draft a team that will win championships, or will your team wollow in misery as the punching bag for the league?

Simply 'sign' players, making sure you get the right amount of people for each position.   If you can't pick players, it's because you already have enough of that position.

After you pick your team, hit 'Standings' to play out a full season.  You can click on any team to see the game-by-game results.

Click back on 'draft' to enter the offseason and work out your roster for next year.

Play out a few seasons, and you'll see your players age.  Young players will get better, older ones will still maintain their wits, but will lose some physical abilities.  Experience counts for a lot - a young team of gifted players may lose to an older less physical team, but only to a point.  Some players will retire, and they'll need to be replaced.

Hopefully your dynasty doesn't come crashing down all at once, leaving you with a poor selection of replacements, and a 5-year rebuilding plan.

Good luck!
